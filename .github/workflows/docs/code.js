The choices were clear: comply with the demands and release a hostage periodically, or ignore the demands and hold onto the hostages as leverage.
        <br><br>
        Choosing to comply with the police demands and release a hostage every five minutes might create a temporary sense of cooperation and reduce the immediate threat of a police assault. It could also be seen as a gesture of goodwill, potentially leading to negotiations or a less aggressive response from law enforcement.
        <br><br>
        Opting to ignore the police demands and hold onto the hostages could be a means of maintaining control and leverage during the heist. It might discourage law enforcement from making any hasty moves but could also escalate tensions and increase the risk of a violent confrontation.
